# KJW's Imposters

Imposters is a standalone undercover mod which adds granular control over how overt certain pieces of equipment make you, allowing for a more diverse range of gameplay and equipment setups. The rewrite has removed the majority of features in favour of using the regular Arma AI directly rather than modifying it; with things such as wanted systems very easily able to be scripted using the CBA events provided.
