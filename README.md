# KJW's Medical Expansion: Imposters

Imposters is a part of [KJW's Medical Expansion](https://github.com/SpicyBagpipes/KJW_MedicalExpansion) set of mods which aim to expand on the existing ACE medical system for Arma 3 with interesting new threats.

Specifically, Imposters implements high-fidelity and high-versatility radiological threats, with an aim on providing the player with a wide range of radiological capabilities that they can add to their missions when they desire, with the exact level of difficulty that suits the players they are making the mission for. The highlights of this mod are:
  - Highly configurable radiological threats, with the capability for players to add their own radiation types.
  - Decontamination from radioactive dust.
  - High-fidelity PPE with a wide range of options for difficulty.
  - Accurate radiation poisoning symptoms and effects (as accurate as you can make it in Arma, anyway).
  - Medications to treat radiation poisoning.
