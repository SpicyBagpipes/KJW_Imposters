A modification for Arma 3 that adds the ability to go undercover, with a variety of caveats and details.

Steam Workshop: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2917554904

## Features
- No keybinds. System runs automatically based on the circumstances around the player; there is no "go undercover" button.
- Sus points
  - Sus points are obtained by completing suspicious actions. These prevent you from being able to go undercover.
- Disguises
  - Configurable classnames are able to be used to create a disguise. Kill a police officer, take his uniform, wait a few seconds for your sus points to reach 0, and you're undercover again.
- Wanted system
  - Forget a balaclava or face covering whilst committing a crime and leave enemy witnesses? They'll add you to the wanted list, preventing you from going undercover.
- Smart AI
  - Enemy AI will be able to figure out where you are for a short amount of time based on your last known position and direction. Keep moving to stop them from showing up and killing you.
